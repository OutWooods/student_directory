# Week 4 Project (for [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy))

This is my work for Makers Academy Pre-course, week 4 where we've built a student directory and had to complete codewars 
kata on particular learning objectives. 

We were also introduced to markdown this week, so am also using this as an opportunity to practise it! Below I've included links to websites I found useful to learning about different aspects of ruby, and codewars kata/other exercises I found were useful to consolidate these skills. I've generally avoided providing answers so you can have a go yourself. 

## Ruby topics 
Topics are listed in order of when I covered them. blocks, procs and lambda's are the three I was least confident with so I started with them first (still don't fully understand the difference). But from my experience, I found going blocks, then procs and then lambdas worked best as blocks link to procs and procs link to lambdas. I also found it helped to look at each topic separately, and spead it out over several days.    

*Note: If you sot any other good sites do let me know (especially sites that talk about **just** procs, they're hard to find), still not 100% confident on bpl's*

- [x] **Focus: Blocks**
	- Sites that were useful: 
    	- [How Yield Works](https://mixandgo.com/blog/mastering-ruby-blocks-in-less-than-5-minutes)  
    	- [Passing Blocks to Methods](https://www.codecademy.com/en/forum_questions/51c72e759c4e9d410501df42)   
    - Kata Completed  
     	- [Yield to the block](https://www.codewars.com/kata/yield-to-the-block)  
     	- [Enumerable Magic](https://www.codewars.com/kata/enumerable-magic-number-7-find-a-matching-item/ruby)  

- [x] **Focus: Procs**
	- Sites that were useful:
	  - [Good guide, especially earlier parts, but gets denser later on](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_10.html)
	  - [Good definition of procs, and helpful for exercises](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Proc.html)
	- Pine Questions Completed, techically they're for blocks, but procs work too. Go [here](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Proc.html) if you want to see the exercises. Down below are my solutions:

		- [Programme Logger, Ex: 2](https://github.com/Tagrand/student_directory/blob/33e20ddeba77ace5b841361766ca05c9d89d02b5/Pine_exercises.rb)

- [x] **Focus: Lambdas** 
  - Sites that were useful:
      - [Best basic explanation (make sure you're confident on procs first)](http://culttt.com/2015/05/13/what-are-lambdas-in-ruby/)
      - [Useful info about how Lambda's work](http://blog.honeybadger.io/using-lambdas-in-ruby/)
      - [Good section on curry, not perfect but best explanation I've found](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/9994331)
  - Kata Completed  
       - [Name That Integer](http://www.codewars.com/kata/name-that-integer/train/ruby) 
        - [Lambdas as a mechanism for Open/Closed](http://www.codewars.com/kata/lambdas-as-a-mechanism-for-open-slash-closed/ruby)
        - [Function Composition](http://www.codewars.com/kata/function-composition/ruby) (This was great for understanding how procs differ from lambdas in taking arguements.)




- [ ] **Recursion**
  - Sites that were useful:
      - [Good intro](http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/12/14/to-understand-recursion-you-must-first-understand-recursion/)
      - [Very challenging, but interesting](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) This is in Javascript. But if you can grasp it (I think I do...in a sense) it gives a really nice example of more complex recursion. But its quite tricky, it took me several reads, re-reads to vaguely grasp it. 
  - Kata Completed  
       - [Directions reduction](http://www.codewars.com/kata/directions-reduction/train/ruby)  *Can be solved without recursion, but the recusrive answer's quite nice.*
- [ ] **Symbols**

- [ ] **Hashes**

- [ ] **Control flows**

- [ ] **Arrays**
  - Kata Completed  
     - [Uses arrays and Hashes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/battle-ships-sunk-damaged-or-not-touched/ruby) High level, quite tricky. 
- [ ] **Methods** 

- [ ] **Variables**

- [ ] **String Interpolation**

- [ ] **Booleans**



## Student directory

The other task was to build a student directory for students at Villans and Makers Academy. This started with a simple ruby structure but then went on to use csv files to store and add data to the programme. If you want to see my final answer go to [solution](typos.rb). 

And if you want to see my answers to the exercises in section 14:
