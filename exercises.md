# Makers Exercises (Week 4)   

This is a collection of the codewars questions I have attempted for each of the learning objectives. *Note: I also did Chris Pine
exercises. Which is why the file name has changed*

of week four of the Makers Academy pre-course.

Since we've just covered markdown, this seemed a good time practise the skill. 

Below are the topics, ordered by relative confidence, with links to the kata that connect to the topic. 
I've also added links to websites that I found useful.
