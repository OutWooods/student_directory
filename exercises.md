# Makers Exercises (Week 4)   

This is a collection of the codewars questions I have attempted for each of the learning objectives. *Note: I also did Chris Pine
exercises. Which is why the file name has changed.*

Since we've just covered markdown, this seemed a good time practise the skill. 

Below are the topics, ordered by relative confidence, with links to the kata that connect to the topic. 
I've also added links to websites that I found useful. 


## Topics ##
*I found alot of sites lumped Lambdas, Pocs, and Blocks together. Since these concepts are quite similar, this makes it quite confusing
so I have generally reccomended sites that try and talk about one on its own. Although its hard to find stuff that talks about **only** procs.
I started with Blocks, then Procs, then Lambdas as I found Blocks simplest and Lambdas hardest.*

- [x] **Focus: Lambdas** 
  - Sites that were useful:
      - [Best basic explanation (make sure you're confident on procs first)](http://culttt.com/2015/05/13/what-are-lambdas-in-ruby/)
      - [Useful info about how Lambda's work](http://blog.honeybadger.io/using-lambdas-in-ruby/)
      - [Good section on curry, not perfect but best explanation I've found](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/9994331)
    - Kata Completed  
        - [Name That Integer](http://www.codewars.com/kata/name-that-integer/train/ruby) 
        - [Lambdas as a mechanism for Open/Closed](http://www.codewars.com/kata/lambdas-as-a-mechanism-for-open-slash-closed/ruby)
        - [Function Composition](http://www.codewars.com/kata/function-composition/ruby) (This was great for understanding how procs differ from lambdas in taking arguements.)
- [x] **Focus: Procs**
	- Sites that were useful:
	  - [Good guide, especially earlier parts, but gets denser later on](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_10.html)
	  - [Good definition of procs, and helpful for exercises](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Proc.html)
	- Pine Questions Completed, techically they're for blocks, but procs work too. [See exercises.](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Proc.html)
