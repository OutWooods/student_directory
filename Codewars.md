# Codewars Learning Objectives # 

This is a collection of the codewars questions I have attempted. For each of the learning objectives. 

I've also used this as an opportunity to practise my markdown usage. 

Below are the topics, ordered by relative confidence. I'll also add links to websites that I found useful. 

Each is crossed off when I have completed 2 codewars problems on the topic.
