# Codewars Learning Objectives # 

This is a collection of the codewars questions I have attempted for each of the learning objectives
of week four of the Makers Academy pre-course.

Since we've just covered markdown, I've also used this as an opportunity to apply what I've learnt. 

Below are the topics, ordered by relative confidence, with links to the kata that connect to the topic. 
I've also added links to websites that I found useful.
